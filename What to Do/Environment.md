# Environment
*This document show how to create a proper environment to a rat*
## Cage
The best home for your rats is a wire cage – the larger and taller the better, as rats are active and love to climb. 
A rat cage should be at least 90cm (L) x 60cm (D) x 120cm (H) for two to five rats (larger for bigger groups). This is just the actual living space and these measurements should not include stands.
The floor should also be solid rather than wire to avoid them trapping and injuring their feet or limbs. Aquarium-style glass cages should not be used because there will not be enough ventilation.
## External Environment
Rats can be quite sensitive to noises and the environment they live in. To help them stay happy and healthy, they'll need to be: indoors – it's too cold for pet rats outside away from any draughts and direct sunlight – rats are sensitive to extreme cold and heat dehydration, both of which can be fatal
somewhere they can see and hear you – they're very social and like to keep an eye on their owners
away from loud noises and vibrations given off by televisions and speakers, as this can be stressful for them.
### Bedding which is safe for your rat includes:
1. a dust extracted bedding, such as paper-based bedding
2. non-aspen wood chips
3. cellulose-based chips
### Bedding to avoid
1. Avoid wood shavings or sawdust as this can cause respiratory problems. 
2. Fluffy or stuffing type bedding can also be dangerous. It can get wrapped around their feet or limbs and cause an injury – it also doesn’t dissolve if eaten.
3. And, because rats are so sensitive to smell, you should not use bedding with an added fragrance.
